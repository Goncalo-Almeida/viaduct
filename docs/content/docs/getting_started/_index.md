## Getting Started with Viaduct

Using a set of scripts bundled with the Viaduct release, this document will walk you through the process of running a very simple Viaduct application.  Viaduct comes with built-in, Gradle-based tooling for building, testing, and running your sample application.  This guide uses that tooling and assumes a basic familiarity with Gradle.

### System Requirements

Java 21 must be on the path or available via JAVA_HOME.

### Running the Simple Application

Viaduct comes with a number of demonstration applications you can find in the `demoapps` directory.  Letâ€™s start with the `demoapps/clihelloworld` application.  Change into that directory and type:

```shell
./gradlew -q run --args="'{ author }'"
```

This command will build the simple application run a graphql query with Viaduct.

## Using Viaduct in your own application

Currently Viaduct is only published to Maven Central as snapshot versions. To use Viaduct in your own application, add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.airbnb.viaduct.application-gradle-plugin") version "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
}


repositories {
  maven {
    name = "Central Portal Snapshots"
    url = uri("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")

    // Only search this repository for the specific dependency
    content {
      includeModule("com.airbnb.viaduct", "runtime")
    }
  }
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation("com.airbnb.viaduct:runtime:0.2.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

And add the following to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    plugins {
        id("com.airbnb.viaduct.application-gradle-plugin") version "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
        id("com.airbnb.viaduct.module-gradle-plugin") version "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
    }
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven {
            name = "Central Portal Snapshots"
            url = uri("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
        }
    }
}
```

### Going further

There are two other demo applications:

- [springhelloworld](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/demoapps/springhelloworld/README.md) - a simple integration of spring with Spring.
- [starwars](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/demoapps/starwars/README.md) - a full-fledged spring application to demonstrate more complex usage of
  Viaduct.
